## Free Alternative: Static to Video

If you can't generate videos, create a **subtle animated version** of a still image:

### Using Canva Pro (has video features)
1. Create 1920x1080 design
2. Add elements (shapes, particles)
3. Apply subtle animations
4. Export as MP4

### Using CSS/Framer Motion (Fallback)
Replace videos with animated gradients and particles:
```typescript
// In your component
<div className="animated-gradient-background">
  {/* Particle effects with Framer Motion */}
</div>
```
